## Why a glossary helps during payroll evaluation

Payroll compliance jargon creates confusion during procurement. Vendors assume you know what every report and acronym means. Finance assumes HR will handle vendor coordination. HR assumes the tool will “just work.”

A glossary helps you:

- ask better demo questions
- understand what reports to demand
- communicate clearly with your CA/finance team

This is not legal advice; it is a practical reference.

## PF (Provident Fund)

**PF**: Retirement savings scheme contributions for eligible employees.

What to ask vendors:

- How do you calculate employee and employer contributions?
- How do you handle arrears and reversals?
- Can we export employee-wise contributions?

Key operational terms:

- **PF wage ceiling**: applicability and contribution limits.
- **Arrears**: backdated changes requiring recalculation.
- **Reversal**: correcting a previous month’s calculation.

## ESI

**ESI**: Social security scheme for eligible employees.

Operational questions:

- How does the system decide applicability month-to-month?
- How do you handle joiners/exits?

Common failure mode: applicability transitions not handled cleanly.

## Professional Tax (PT)

**PT**: State-level tax with state-specific slabs.

Why it’s tricky:

- slabs differ by state
- employees may transfer states

Ask vendors:

- show PT for two states in one month
- how do transfers work

## TDS

**TDS**: Tax Deducted at Source (income tax deductions from salary).

Even if a CA files, you need clean outputs.

Ask:

- investment declaration workflow (if supported)
- Form 16 approach
- export formats

## Payroll register

A monthly report listing employee-wise salary components and totals.

You need it to reconcile bank advice and cost centers.

## Bank advice

Export used to process salary payments through bank.

Ask:

- does it support your bank format?
- can it split by entity/location?

## Audit log / change history

A record of:

- who changed salary inputs
- who approved overrides
- when reruns happened

If the tool has no audit log, treat it as risk.

## Variance report

A report comparing this month vs last month payroll totals.

This is one of the most useful “month-end sanity checks.”

## Full & final settlement

Steps and calculations for employees leaving mid-month.

Validate:

- leave encashment
- recoveries
- variable pay

## Recommended next steps

Use this glossary to drive better demos: ask vendors to show the reports, not just the UI.

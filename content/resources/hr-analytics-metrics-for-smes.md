## HR analytics should answer operational questions

Many SME teams get stuck because “analytics” becomes a BI project. For HR operations, analytics should be simple:

- What’s changing month to month?
- Where are approvals stuck?
- Are we at risk at month-end?
- Are we hiring effectively?

You don’t need dashboards for everything. You need a small set of metrics that drive action.

## Metric set 1: Hiring (ATS)

1) **Time to hire (role-wise)**

- Why it matters: identifies bottlenecks (sourcing vs interviews vs offers).
- Operationalize: track time-in-stage.

2) **Offer acceptance rate**

- Why: compensation/process issues show up here.
- Operationalize: log reasons for declines.

3) **Source quality**

- Why: reduces noise from low-quality channels.
- Operationalize: track stage conversion by source.

4) **Interviewer feedback SLA**

- Why: hiring slows when feedback is late.
- Operationalize: reminders and scorecards.

## Metric set 2: Retention and workforce

5) **Attrition (monthly, voluntary/involuntary)**

- Why: early warning on team health.
- Operationalize: exit reason codes.

6) **New joiner 90-day attrition**

- Why: onboarding/process fit issues.
- Operationalize: track by role and manager.

7) **Headcount by location/department**

- Why: capacity planning.
- Operationalize: ensure employee master data is clean.

## Metric set 3: Attendance and operations

8) **Attendance exception rate**

- Why: shows policy friction or device failure.
- Operationalize: measure missed punches and overrides.

9) **Leave approval cycle time**

- Why: indicates manager adoption.
- Operationalize: reminders and escalations.

10) **Overtime concentration**

- Why: signals staffing gaps.
- Operationalize: weekly review for teams with high OT.

## Metric set 4: Payroll and compliance

11) **Payroll variance vs last month**

- Why: catches issues early.
- Operationalize: require variance report before payout.

12) **Rerun count / override count**

- Why: reruns indicate unstable inputs.
- Operationalize: audit logs.

## How to implement analytics without heavy BI

- Start with exports (CSV/Excel) and a shared month-end workbook.
- Make reports part of monthly SOPs.
- Only automate once reports are stable.

## Recommended next steps

Choose tools that make reporting and exports easy. Analytics is a workflow, not a dashboard.

## Why you need an RFP (even if you’re only talking to 3 vendors)

Most HRMS purchases fail because evaluation is unstructured. A vendor demo looks good, but the system doesn’t fit your month-end realities: approvals, exports, auditability, and policy edge cases.

A simple RFP (Request for Proposal) helps you:

- compare vendors on the *same* questions
- force clarity on implementation and support
- document assumptions (so you don’t get surprised later)
- negotiate exports, audit logs, and SLAs upfront

This template is intentionally SME-friendly: short enough to use, detailed enough to catch real risk.

## Section 1: Company context (fill this first)

- Company name:
- Employee count today / projected 12 months:
- Locations/states:
- Industries/worker types (office/field/plant):
- Payroll responsibility (in-house vs outsourced):
- Attendance complexity (shifts, overtime, biometric, field staff):
- Target go-live date:
- Primary internal owner (HR):
- Finance owner (month-end):
- IT/security reviewer:

## Section 2: Scope for the first 60 days (v1)

Mark **In scope** / **Out of scope**.

**Core HRMS**

- Employee master + org structure
- Documents storage + download
- Policy acknowledgements
- Workflows/approvals
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit log
- Reporting and exports

**Optional (phase 2)**

- Attendance/leave
- Payroll/compliance module
- ATS
- Performance/OKR

The vendor should propose an implementation plan aligned to this.

## Section 3: Must-have requirements (pass/fail)

### Data and exports

- Employee master export available on demand (CSV/Excel)
- Documents export / bulk download option (with structure)
- Audit log export (who changed what)
- APIs (optional), but exports are non-negotiable

### Permissions and auditability

- RBAC supports HR vs manager vs employee
- Sensitive fields (salary, IDs) can be restricted
- Audit trail for edits, approvals, overrides

### Workflows

- HR can configure workflows without custom development
- Approval visibility (pending/approved/rejected)
- Reminders/escalations for pending approvals

### Support

- Named escalation path
- Response SLAs during month-end (if payroll/attendance involved)

## Section 4: Demo script (use this in every vendor demo)

Ask the vendor to do the following live (not slides):

1) Create a new employee record
2) Upload 2 documents and show access permissions
3) Change manager/department and show audit trail
4) Run a policy acknowledgement workflow
5) Export employee master
6) Show 3 key reports:
   - headcount by location/department
   - joiners/leavers
   - missing documents / acknowledgements

If attendance is in scope:

- missed punch flow + approvals
- shift assignment
- attendance lock for month-end

If payroll is in scope:

- arrears and reversals
- statutory summaries
- rerun payroll safely

## Section 5: Implementation plan (what we expect)

Vendors should provide:

- a week-by-week plan
- what they need from us
- templates required
- training approach (HR + managers)
- go-live support window

A typical 50–500 rollout is 3–6 weeks depending on complexity.

## Section 6: Commercials (pricing + contract)

Please provide:

- pricing model (PEPM, seats)
- modules included/excluded
- one-time implementation fee (what’s included)
- renewal policy and assumptions

Contract clauses to include:

- data ownership
- export guarantee (employee master + documents + audit logs)
- support SLAs + escalation
- implementation scope in writing

## Section 7: Security and privacy

- Data storage location and retention
- Access controls and admin permissions
- Audit logs
- SSO (if supported)

## Section 8: Scoring sheet (1–5)

Score each vendor:

- Fit to v1 scope
- Export quality
- RBAC + audit trail
- Workflow flexibility
- Reporting usability
- Implementation clarity
- Support SLA quality

Shortlist the top 2–3 and run a second demo focused on edge cases.

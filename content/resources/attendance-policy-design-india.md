## Why attendance policy matters more than the tool

Attendance and leave software doesn’t create discipline—policy does.

Many implementations fail because teams buy a tool and then try to discover policy through configuration. That leads to rework, unhappy managers, and month-end payroll confusion.

This playbook lists the decisions Indian SMEs should make before selecting or configuring attendance/leave systems.

## Step 1: Define your employee groups

Most SMEs have multiple groups:

- corporate/office staff
- field staff
- shift staff
- contract workers (if tracked)

For each group, define whether attendance is:

- strict (shift-based)
- flexible (core hours)
- output-based (no daily tracking)

If you treat all groups the same, the policy becomes unworkable.

## Step 2: Decide the attendance “source of truth”

Pick one:

- biometric device
- mobile app with geo
- manager approval
- spreadsheets/imports

Then decide what happens when the source fails.

Examples:

- If biometric sync fails, do we allow manual punch requests?
- Who approves manual changes?
- Is there a monthly cap on overrides?

Tools can support many sources, but you must define the hierarchy.

## Step 3: Cutoffs and month-end lock

Payroll and attendance require a lock.

Decide:

- payroll cutoff date
- attendance cutoff date (often aligned)
- how many days after cutoff are corrections allowed

A simple approach:

- lock attendance on Day 1–2
- allow corrections until Day 3 with HR approval
- rerun exports once for finance

## Step 4: Missed punches and exceptions

Missed punch workflows become the #1 daily HR ticket if poorly designed.

Decide:

- how employees request corrections
- evidence required (optional)
- manager SLA (e.g., approve in 48 hours)
- escalation if managers don’t respond

The software should support:

- visible pending requests
- reminders
- audit log for overrides

## Step 5: Late/early rules

If you implement strict late rules, managers need transparency.

Decide:

- grace minutes per day
- late frequency thresholds
- early departures handling

Be careful: overly strict rules cause manual exceptions and reduce trust.

## Step 6: Overtime and comp-off

Overtime rules are where many systems break.

Decide:

- who is eligible
- how overtime is calculated
- approval flow
- comp-off vs payout

Ensure the tool can handle the policy you choose.

## Step 7: Leave types and accruals

Define:

- leave types (CL/SL/EL, etc.)
- accrual frequency (monthly/yearly)
- carry-forward rules
- encashment rules

If policies vary by location, define it explicitly.

## Step 8: Holidays and location calendars

India is multi-holiday and multi-location.

Decide:

- holiday calendar per location
- optional holidays/floating holidays
- how holidays affect shift workers

## Step 9: Manager training and adoption plan

Even the best system fails if managers don’t approve.

Plan:

- a manager pilot
- a one-page manager guide
- a reminder cadence

## Implementation checklist

Before go-live:

- policy decisions signed off
- group definitions finalized
- attendance source-of-truth agreed
- exception workflows tested
- month-end lock rehearsed

## Recommended next steps

If attendance is a pain point, shortlist tools by workflow fit (exceptions, approvals, exports) rather than by device integrations alone.

## BGV is a trust workflow, not a vendor purchase

Background verification affects candidate experience, time-to-hire, and risk.

SMEs often swing between two extremes:

- under-checking (risk)
- over-checking (slow hiring, poor candidate experience)

A better approach is role-based checks and clear consent.

## Step 1: Define role-based check levels

Example levels:

- Level 1 (low risk): identity + basic education
- Level 2 (medium): employment + references
- Level 3 (high): address + criminal + court record checks (as applicable)

Not every role needs Level 3.

## Step 2: Candidate consent and communication

Define:

- when consent is collected
- what is shared with the candidate
- how disputes are handled

A good BGV workflow reduces drop-offs.

## Step 3: Data retention (privacy-first)

Decide:

- how long reports are retained
- who can access reports
- deletion process

BGV data is sensitive. Treat it like payroll data.

## Step 4: Vendor evaluation questions

Ask vendors:

- turnaround times by check type
- exception handling
- audit trail and access controls
- integrations with ATS/HRMS (or export formats)

## Step 5: Operational success criteria

Before going live:

- define SLA by role
- define escalation for delays
- test candidate comms templates

## Recommended next steps

Shortlist BGV tools by workflow clarity and SLA reliability, not by the longest list of checks.

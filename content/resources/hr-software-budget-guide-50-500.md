## Why HR software budgets blow up

For 50–500 employees, HR software stops being “a tool” and becomes an operating system for people ops. Budgets blow up for predictable reasons:

- Teams price only subscription and ignore implementation, support and internal time.
- Teams buy too many modules before processes are stable.
- Renewals become expensive because exports, RBAC or month-end support are locked behind higher tiers.

A credible budget is not “the cheapest tool.” It’s a plan that:

- fits your size band today and next year
- funds the first month-end properly
- protects you from lock‑in (exports + auditability)

This guide is directional planning, not a quote.

## Step 1: Budget using four buckets

Split costs into four buckets:

1) Subscription (monthly/annual)
2) Implementation (one-time)
3) Support & success (SLA, training, priority support)
4) Internal time (HR + finance + IT)

If you budget only subscription, surprises are guaranteed.

## Step 2: Pricing models you’ll see in India

### Per employee per month (PEPM)

Common for HRMS and attendance.

Ask:

- Active employees vs total records?
- Contractors included?
- Minimum employee count?
- Renewal pricing policy?

### Module add-ons

Payroll, performance and ATS often add cost.

Watch for:

- exports/audit logs paywalled
- compliance reporting only in higher tiers

### Seat-based pricing

Common for ATS (recruiter seats).

Clarify:

- managers charged?
- viewer roles free?

### Implementation packages

Some vendors bundle implementation into mandatory packages.

Ask:

- what is included (migration, training, month-end support)?
- what is out-of-scope?

## Step 3: What actually drives cost (by module)

### Core HRMS

Cost drivers:

- RBAC requirements
- audit logs and exports
- document storage/downloads
- reporting depth

Practical tip: treat exports as lock-in insurance.

### Attendance/leave

Cost drivers:

- shifts and overtime
- biometric/device sync
- missed punch workflows
- field staff requirements

### Payroll/compliance

Cost drivers:

- multi-state PT
- arrears and reversals
- final settlement
- month-end support

### ATS

Cost drivers:

- recruiter seats
- scorecards and reminders
- reporting
- offer workflow

### Performance/OKR

Cost drivers:

- manager adoption
- review templates and cadence
- analytics/calibration (if needed)

## Step 4: Implementation budgeting (don’t underfund this)

Even if implementation is “free,” internal time is not.

Budget for:

- master data cleanup
- policy decisions
- manager training
- month-end rehearsal (if payroll included)

Underfunding implementation increases manual work and delays ROI.

## Step 5: Renewal and contract clauses

Protect your future budget:

- export guarantee (employee master + payroll outputs + audit logs)
- support SLA and escalation
- renewal predictability (caps/guardrails)
- data ownership clause

If a vendor refuses exports, treat it as a deal-breaker.

## Step 6: Where to invest vs where to be cautious

Invest in:

- RBAC + audit trail
- exports
- month-end support
- manager UX

Be cautious about:

- advanced analytics before data is clean
- AI features without workflow value
- heavy customization

## A practical 3-phase plan

Phase 1 (0–60 days)

- core HRMS + documents + approvals
- attendance/leave if needed
- export-ready reporting

Phase 2 (60–120 days)

- payroll module or payroll integration
- month-end stabilization

Phase 3 (120+ days)

- ATS or performance depending on needs

## Recommended next steps

- Use **Get Recommendations** and choose your size band and rough budget.
- Use **Compare** to verify what is included at each tier.

## Practical budget scenarios (to make this real)

### Scenario A: 50–150 employees, single location, simple payroll

Typical approach:

- Start with core HRMS + attendance.
- Keep payroll either outsourced or as a later module once attendance is stable.

Hidden costs to plan for:

- Data cleanup time (employee master)
- Manager training for approvals

### Scenario B: 150–500 employees, multiple locations, multi-state complexity

Typical approach:

- HRMS + attendance + strong month-end exports are non-negotiable.
- Budget extra implementation time for policies and exceptions.

Hidden costs to plan for:

- Multi-state PT complexity
- Overtime and shift rules configuration
- Support during first month-end

### Scenario C: High-growth hiring team (ATS pressure)

If hiring is a weekly fire:

- Budget ATS early (scorecards + reminders) and keep HRMS scope minimal.
- Don’t over-integrate in month 1; use exports.

## Questions to ask vendors during procurement

- What is included in the plan we will actually buy (RBAC, audit logs, exports)?
- What is the renewal policy and expected increases?
- What is the month-end support SLA (and escalation path)?
- Can we export all data at any time? (employee master + documents + logs)

## Hidden costs to watch for (common in India)

- Mandatory implementation fees for payroll/compliance setup
- Charges for additional locations/entities
- Costs for premium support during month-end
- Charges for exports/APIs/audit logs in higher tiers

## How to make budgeting decisions without overcommitting

- Start with a 60-day scope and price that plan, not the full suite.
- Ask for a written breakdown: base plan + add-ons + implementation + support.
- Prefer plans that allow you to add modules later without migrating.

## A simple budgeting worksheet (use this)

Create a table with these columns:

- Tool/module
- Monthly subscription
- One-time implementation
- Support/SLA tier
- Internal hours (HR/finance/IT)
- Month-end risk (low/medium/high)

Fill it for 2–3 vendors. The winner is the tool that reduces month-end risk and internal hours—not the one with the smallest PEPM.

## Negotiation tips (practical)

- Ask for exports and audit logs in writing.
- Ask for a month-end support window for the first 2 payroll cycles.
- If pricing is seat-based, negotiate manager/viewer roles.

## Recommended next steps

- Use **Get Recommendations** and choose your size band and rough budget.
- Use **Compare** to verify what is included at each tier.

## Final sanity check

If your budget plan does not include exports and month-end support, it is not complete. Those two items decide whether HR software reduces work or creates more.

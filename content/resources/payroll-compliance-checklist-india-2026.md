## What this checklist is (and isn’t)

This is an operational buyer checklist for Indian SMEs evaluating payroll software (or a payroll module inside an HRMS). It is not legal advice. The goal is to prevent the most common outcomes:

- Payroll works in the demo but breaks during month-end.
- Compliance outputs can’t be reconciled or audited.
- Multi-state complexity is discovered after implementation.

If payroll is mission-critical, treat the choice like accounting software: predictable outputs, auditability, and reliable support.

## Step 0: Define your payroll reality

Before you ask vendors anything, write these down:

- Employee count today and in 12 months
- States you operate in (and expansion plans)
- Salary structure complexity (allowances, variable pay, reimbursements)
- Contractor vs employee mix
- Attendance rules (late/early, overtime, comp-offs)
- Finance system (Tally/Zoho Books/ERP/spreadsheets)
- Filing responsibilities (in-house vs CA)

A strong vendor will tailor the demo to these.

## Step 1: Compliance areas to validate (India)

### PF (Provident Fund)

Validate:

- Coverage rules supported (thresholds, exceptions)
- Handling of arrears and reversals (backdated changes)
- Month-end PF summary and challan workflow

Demo scenario: employee gets a backdated increment and arrears. PF should recalculate correctly.

Questions:

- How do you handle PF wage ceilings and exemptions?
- Can we export PF employee-wise contribution details?
- Do you keep an audit trail for overrides?

### ESI

Validate:

- Applicability rules and transitions
- Joiners/exits handling
- ESI contribution reports + reconciliation

Red flag: vendor can’t explain month-to-month applicability changes.

### Professional Tax (PT)

PT is where many tools fail for multi-state SMEs.

Validate:

- PT support for each state you operate in
- Transfers between states/locations
- Export formats and reconciliation

Ask explicitly: show PT for two states in one month.

### TDS / income tax outputs (where applicable)

Validate:

- Investment declaration workflow (if provided)
- Form 16 support approach
- Clean data outputs for filing processes

Even if you use a CA, you need clean, consistent data.

## Step 2: Month-end operations checklist (where payroll really fails)

Compliance rules are necessary, but payroll fails on process.

### Attendance → payroll handoff

- How do you lock attendance for the month?
- Are overtime/late deductions approved?
- How are missed punches handled?
- Are exceptions visible in one place?

If attendance is manual, ensure the system supports repeatable imports.

### Exceptions and corrections

- Can you run a dry run payroll?
- Can you revert and rerun safely?
- Is there an audit trail for overrides?
- Can you compare “this month vs last month” quickly?

A payroll system without safe reruns is high risk.

### Full & final settlement

Validate:

- Full & final settlement steps
- Leave encashment rules
- Recoveries/advances
- Variable pay inclusion rules

Demo scenario: employee exits mid-month with pending recoveries and variable pay.

## Step 3: Reports you must demand (ask for sample PDFs/exports)

Minimum set:

- Payroll register
- Payslip
- Statutory summaries (PF/ESI/PT)
- Employee-wise contribution reports
- Variance report vs last month
- Audit log / change history

Reconciliation-friendly reports:

- Totals by cost center/location
- Bank advice / payout export
- Adjustments log (arrears, reversals)

If the vendor won’t share sample outputs, treat it as risk.

## Step 4: Integrations (keep it boring)

Many SMEs try to integrate too early.

A practical approach:

1) Month 1: exports only
2) Month 2: mapping + repeatable import
3) Month 3: automation (if stable)

Define owners: HR vs Finance.

## Step 5: Implementation questions you should ask

- Who configures statutory settings—vendor or you?
- What data templates are required?
- Typical timeline for your size and states?
- What happens during first month-end? Is there dedicated support?
- Escalation path if payroll is blocked?

A vendor who has done multiple India payroll rollouts should answer clearly.

## Common failure modes (watch for these)

- Over-customized salary structures
- Attendance rules not aligned with payroll cutoffs
- Multi-state PT handled manually
- No audit trail for overrides
- Reports change after reruns

## Quick vendor scorecard

Score 1–5:

- PF/ESI/PT/TDS coverage
- multi-state readiness
- month-end reconciliation outputs
- rerun/rollback safety
- support SLA quality
- auditability (logs + exports)

## The 20-minute vendor evaluation drill

If you only have 20 minutes with a vendor, do this:

1) Ask them to show sample PF/ESI/PT reports (PDF/export)
2) Ask how they handle arrears + reversals
3) Ask how they rerun payroll safely
4) Ask the support SLA during month-end

If any answer is vague, treat it as risk.

## Implementation success criteria

Before go-live, confirm:

- Attendance lock and exception workflow are defined
- Payroll dry run completed
- Exports match finance expectations
- Escalation path is tested

## A checklist of must-have reports (copy into your vendor email)

Ask vendors to share anonymized samples of:

- payroll register
- payslip
- PF/ESI/PT summaries
- employee-wise contribution details
- variance report vs last month
- audit log / change history

If they cannot share samples, ask to screen-share live during demo.

## What to ask your finance team (so you don’t miss requirements)

Before choosing a tool, ask finance:

- What exports do you need monthly?
- Do you need cost center/location splits?
- Do you reconcile payroll totals with bank advice?
- What format does Tally/Zoho Books accept?

If HR buys payroll without finance inputs, month-end friction is guaranteed.

## Controls and governance (simple but essential)

Even a small company should decide basic controls:

- Who can edit salary components?
- Who can override attendance inputs?
- Who approves reruns?
- How long are payroll outputs retained and where?

Insist on an audit trail for overrides and reruns. In an audit or dispute, the question is always: “Who changed what, and why?”

- Already comparing tools? Use **Compare** and focus on reports and rerun workflows.

## Final note

Payroll is a trust system. Choose the tool that produces stable, reconcilable outputs—not the tool that demos the most features.

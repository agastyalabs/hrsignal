## Why a demo script matters

Most HR software demos are designed to impress. They show the best screens and skip the messy parts:

- backdated changes
- approvals that get stuck
- exports that don’t reconcile
- permissions that are too broad

A demo script flips the power dynamic. You force the vendor to run **your workflow**, end-to-end.

Use this script with every vendor. Record the session. Score pass/fail.

## Pre-demo: send the vendor your context (24 hours before)

Share:

- employee count + growth
- states/locations
- attendance complexity (shifts/overtime/field staff)
- payroll responsibility (in-house/CA)
- go-live timeline

Ask them to prepare a demo that follows the agenda below.

## The 45-minute agenda

### 0–5 minutes: Setup

- confirm modules in scope
- confirm pricing model (subscription + implementation + support)
- confirm who is doing configuration

### 5–20 minutes: Employee lifecycle (audit + permissions)

Ask them to:

1) create a new employee
2) upload 2 documents
3) show role-based access (manager vs HR)
4) change manager/department and show the audit trail
5) export the employee master

Pass/fail:

- audit trail exists
- exports are straightforward
- sensitive fields can be restricted

### 20–30 minutes: Workflows (where adoption fails)

Ask them to configure and run:

- policy acknowledgement
- approval for profile change

Pass/fail:

- HR can configure without custom dev
- reminders/escalations exist
- approvals are obvious for managers

### 30–40 minutes: Payroll and month-end reality (if payroll is in scope)

Ask them to demonstrate:

- attendance lock workflow
- arrears + reversal scenario
- statutory summaries and exports
- rerun payroll safely

Pass/fail:

- reruns don’t corrupt prior outputs
- reports are stable and reconcilable

### 40–45 minutes: Support and implementation

Ask:

- what happens during first month-end?
- escalation path?
- SLA for blockers?

If the vendor cannot answer, assume risk.

## Edge-case questions (ask these even if the demo looks great)

- How do you handle multi-state PT?
- How do transfers between locations work?
- Can we export audit logs?
- Can you show a variance report vs last month?

## Scoring sheet

Score 1–5:

- exports and reports
- RBAC and auditability
- workflow flexibility
- month-end support
- implementation clarity

Shortlist the top 2–3 and run a second edge-case demo.

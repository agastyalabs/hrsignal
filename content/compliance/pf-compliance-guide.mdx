## Who this guide is for

If you run payroll in India and want fewer month-end surprises, this guide is for HR/Ops/Finance teams who need a **PF-safe** setup across branches, salary structures, and exceptions.

## PF basics (the parts that break in practice)

### Coverage & applicability

- Establishment coverage vs employee coverage can diverge.
- Employee eligibility and exclusions need to be reflected in your payroll master data.

### Wage definition & components

PF computations often break when allowances are configured inconsistently across employee groups.

## Month-end checklist (PF)

- [ ] PF wage components mapped consistently
- [ ] PF ceiling treatment confirmed
- [ ] Arrears & reversals tested
- [ ] Final settlement (FnF) tested

## What to validate in a vendor demo

### Edge cases to ask for

- Arrears posting and retro recalculation
- Salary structure change mid-month
- Employee transfers across states/branches

### Evidence to request

- PF calculation notes in documentation
- Sample PF register outputs

## Implementation tips

Treat PF as a **controls problem**, not a UI problem: maker-checker, audit logs, and correction workflows matter.

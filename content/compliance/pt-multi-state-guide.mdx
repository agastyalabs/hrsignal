## Why PT becomes painful in multi-state payroll

PT differs by state: slabs, exemptions, and registration requirements. The operational risk comes from **employee movement** and inconsistent masters.

## Core requirements

### State-wise slab handling

You need state-specific slabs and a way to keep them current.

### Transfers and location overrides

- [ ] Employee transfer changes PT state correctly
- [ ] Retro adjustments are recomputed
- [ ] Reports separate state-wise PT liability

## Demo validation checklist

### Ask for these flows

- Employee transfer mid-month
- Multiple branches under one entity
- Maker-checker for master changes

## Implementation notes

Treat PT like a configuration lifecycle: updates, approvals, and auditability.

## What breaks in TDS (in real payroll)

TDS is a workflow problem: declarations, proofs, exceptions, and audit trails.

## Must-have workflows

### Declarations and proofs

- Ability to capture declarations
- Proof verification workflow (maker-checker)

### Monthly deduction logic

- [ ] Projection recalculations work
- [ ] One-off adjustments are traceable
- [ ] Final settlement is handled

## Outputs

### Form 16 and related artifacts

Request sample outputs and confirm how corrections are reflected.

## Demo validation checklist

- Declaration + proof submission
- Recompute after salary revision
- Audit logs for edits

UI/UX Improvement Plan for HR Signal

Introduction

HR Signal is an India-focused HR-software discovery platform whose mission is to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) quickly identify the right tools for payroll, compliance, attendance, recruitment and performance management. The current site (available at hrsignal.vercel.app) already features a clean, minimalist layout with a clear call-to-action (CTA), a hero message describing the product value and category cards for different HR-software segments. However, when compared with comprehensive software-comparison providers like SoftwareSuggest or other SaaS comparison sites, there are opportunities to improve the information architecture, user engagement and trust signals. The following report benchmarks HR Signal against best-of-breed platforms, summarizes evidence-based UX guidelines and provides a detailed roadmap to elevate the look and feel of the site.

Current State Analysis

Strengths
• Minimalist hero section. The landing page succinctly describes the purpose of the platform (“Find the right HR software for your business — fast.”) and offers two prominent CTAs (“Get recommendations” and “Browse tools”) with a bold purple accent color.
• Categorical filters. Buttons for key categories (Core HRMS, Payroll + Compliance, Attendance/Leave/Time, ATS/Hiring and Performance/OKR) allow users to quickly narrow their search.
• Privacy-first messaging. A “Privacy-first” badge and explanatory text assure users that data will not be sold.
• Clean typography and white space. The site uses a light background, dark text and generous spacing, promoting readability.

Areas for Improvement
• Limited social proof and trust indicators. Unlike SoftwareSuggest, which highlights being trusted by more than a million businesses and features thousands of verified reviews, HR Signal lacks metrics showing its community size or user satisfaction.
• Missing ratings and reviews. Product cards on HR Signal do not show star ratings or user reviews. Competitor sites present average ratings and the number of reviews to build trust and help users compare products quickly.
• No interactive comparison tables. HR Signal’s current design lists trending tools but does not offer side-by-side comparisons.
• Sparse search and filter options. The search field on the landing page is an input box with limited filtering.
• Underutilized testimonials. There is only a small testimonial section at the bottom of the page.
• Navigation can be enhanced. The navigation bar currently lists Tools, Vendors and a CTA.
• No blog or resources section.
• Accessibility and responsive design gaps.

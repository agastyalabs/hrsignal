## Intro (what it is)
- greytHR is a cloud HRMS + payroll platform built for Indian SMBs.
- Primary jobs-to-be-done: employee records, attendance/leave policies, payroll processing, statutory workflows.
- Deployment: SaaS (cloud) based on vendor positioning.
- Typical buyers: HR admins, payroll teams, finance.
- Scope guardrail: confirm multi-entity and complex shift edge-cases during evaluation.

## Fit summary (who it’s for)
### Best-fit
- SMBs that want an all-in-one HRMS + payroll baseline.
- Organizations with attendance/leave policy complexity (shifts, holidays) that feed payroll.
- Buyers who want India statutory workflows in the primary system.

### Not ideal when
- Enterprise governance requirements (SSO/SCIM/audit logs) are mandatory and need evidence by plan tier.
- Very complex multi-entity payroll or heavy integrations are required without a verified API/marketplace.

## Modules & capabilities (what you actually get)
### Core modules
- **Core HR**: employee master, org structure, documents (needs validation for audit/controls depth).
- **Attendance/Leave**: policy setup, shifts/holidays, approvals (needs validation for device/offline nuances).
- **Payroll**: monthly payroll cycles and statutory outputs (needs validation for edge cases: arrears/reversals/cutoffs).

### Admin & workflow
- Approvals/workflows: needs validation (confirm role/permission model and audit trail coverage).
- Reporting: needs validation (confirm statutory and reconciliation reporting depth).

### Known constraints
- Integration depth and API/webhooks: needs validation.

## Pricing model (how it’s charged)
- **Pricing metric**: PEPM (typical for SaaS HRMS) — needs validation against an official pricing page.
- **Plan structure**: needs validation.
- **Common add-ons**: needs validation.
- **India commercial notes** (INR/GST): needs validation.

## Integrations (how it connects)
- **HRIS/Payroll adjacency**: greytHR positions itself as the system containing payroll/statutory workflows.
- **Marketplace/API**: needs validation (confirm integration catalog and API/webhooks availability).

## Compliance & security (India buyer lens)
- **India HR compliance scope**: payroll/statutory modules are in-scope per positioning, but PF/ESI/PT/TDS specifics must be validated.
- **Security controls / attestations** (SOC2/ISO, encryption, audit logs): needs validation.
- **Data residency**: needs validation.

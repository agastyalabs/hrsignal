## Intro (what it is)
- Keka is a cloud HRMS platform with payroll and common HR modules used by Indian SMBs and mid-market buyers.
- Primary jobs-to-be-done: core HR + attendance/leave + payroll runs + employee self-service.
- Deployment: SaaS (cloud) based on vendor positioning.
- Typical buyers: HR + payroll teams; IT for SSO/integrations (plan-dependent).

## Fit summary (who it’s for)
### Best-fit
- Growing companies that want a modern HRMS with payroll + attendance/leave.
- Teams that want self-service UX and structured workflows.
- Buyers that can validate statutory edge cases in a focused demo (arrears/reversals/cutoffs).

### Not ideal when
- You require on-prem deployment.
- You require verified SOC2/ISO scope, SSO/audit logs, and data residency guarantees immediately without plan-tier evidence.

## Modules & capabilities (what you actually get)
### Core modules
- **Core HR**: employee master, org, documents (needs validation for audit/controls depth).
- **Attendance/Leave**: shift policies, approvals, exceptions (needs validation for device/offline nuances).
- **Payroll**: monthly payroll with statutory workflows (needs validation for PF/ESI/PT/TDS and multi-state nuance).
- **Performance**: cycles/OKRs (needs validation for calibration/reporting depth).

### Admin & workflow
- Permissions/RBAC and audit trails: needs validation (confirm plan tier).
- Reporting: needs validation (statutory and reconciliation reports).

### Known constraints
- Integration depth and API/webhooks: needs validation.

## Pricing model (how it’s charged)
- **Pricing metric**: PEPM — needs validation against an official pricing page/rate card.
- **Plan structure**: needs validation.
- **Commercial notes for India** (INR/GST): needs validation.

## Integrations (how it connects)
- **Accounting exports** (e.g., Tally) and attendance device flows: needs validation.
- **Identity & access** (SSO/SAML/SCIM): needs validation.
- **Marketplace/API**: needs validation.

## Compliance & security (India buyer lens)

- **Security controls / attestations** (SOC2/ISO, encryption, audit logs): needs validation.
- **Data residency**: needs validation.

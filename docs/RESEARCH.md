# RESEARCH (Aligned to PRODUCT_DECISION)

## Positioning (India-first SME)
HRSignal helps Indian SMEs **choose the right HR software** (HRMS, payroll/compliance, attendance, ATS, performance)
through a guided questionnaire + explainable recommendations — and connects them to vendors via qualified leads.

## Top 5 categories (MVP)
1) **Core HRMS**
   - Pain: scattered employee records, onboarding chaos, documents everywhere
   - Triggers: hiring spurt, audits, moving from Excel
2) **Payroll + Statutory Compliance (PF/ESI/PT/TDS)**
   - Pain: compliance risk, month-end payroll errors, penalties, dependence on 1 person
   - Triggers: crossing headcount threshold, PF/ESI applicability, accountant overload
3) **Attendance/Leave/Time**
   - Pain: shift handling, field staff tracking, biometric mismatch, leave disputes
   - Triggers: multiple shifts/sites, factory/retail teams, WFH policy
4) **ATS / Hiring**
   - Pain: resumes lost, long time-to-hire, no pipeline visibility
   - Triggers: growing teams, multiple roles open, recruiter dependency
5) **Performance/OKR**
   - Pain: no review structure, attrition, lack of goals/feedback cadence
   - Triggers: attrition spike, leadership push, scaling org layers

# Inspiration: B2B software marketplaces / directories (SoftwareSuggest-style)

Goal: collect UI/IA patterns for a B2B software discovery + lead-gen marketplace (categories → lists → product pages → comparisons → reviews → “get pricing/demo” flows).

**Important:** Use these as *layout/pattern* references only. Do **not** copy competitor text, badges, review numbers, or proprietary visuals.

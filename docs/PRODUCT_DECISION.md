# PRODUCT_DECISION (LOCKED)

Decision: HRSignal v1 = **HR software discovery + recommendations for Indian SMEs**
(Not HR analytics/alerts. Not a mixed scope. Keep MVP tight.)

## Target buyer
- Indian SMEs/MSMEs (20–500 employees) and “SME-plus” (500–2000) where needed.
- Primary: Founder/Owner, HR Head/Manager, Finance/Accounts for payroll/compliance.

## Monetization
- Lead-based model: Vendors pay per qualified lead (CPL) or revenue-share on conversions.
- Capture intent + requirements → route lead to relevant vendors + track outcome.

## Core MVP outcomes
1) Buyer can discover HR tools by category
2) Buyer can answer a short questionnaire to get recommendations
3) Buyer can submit a lead request
4) Admin can manage vendors/tools/categories and see leads

## Initial categories (top 5)
1) Core HRMS (employee lifecycle, org, docs)
2) Payroll + Statutory Compliance (India-first: PF/ESI/PT/TDS)
3) Attendance/Leave/Time (biometric, shifts, field staff)
4) ATS / Hiring (job posting, pipeline, interviews)
5) Performance/OKR (reviews, goals)

## Non-goals (for MVP)
- No complex analytics product
- No full marketplace payments
- No deep integrations initially (only “supports integration with X” metadata)

## AI recommender (v1)
- Rule-based scoring + explainable reasons
- Outputs: 3–5 matched tools + why + pricing band + compliance fit
